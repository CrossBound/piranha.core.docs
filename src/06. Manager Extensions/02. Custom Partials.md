# Custom Partials

Besides adding custom stylesheets and scripts into the manager interface you can also add global **partial views** into the `Layout` of the manager. This is useful if you for example want to add a modal for a custom field that should be available on all manager views, or perhaps even a custom toolbar.

## Adding The Partial

The partial collection can be accessed from the `Partials` property. This collection holds all custom partials that has been added by your own code, or other modules. Below is an example of how to add a custom partial to the collection.

    using Piranha;

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
    {
        ...

        App.Modules.Get<Piranha.Manager.Module>()
           .Partials.Add("Partial/_MyModal");

        ...
    }

All custom partials are rendered at the end of the body tag **after** the built-in modals have been added.
