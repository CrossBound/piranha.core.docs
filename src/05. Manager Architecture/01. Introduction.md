# Introduction

The manager application is built as a `ASP.NET` application with `Razor Pages`, `Vue.js` and `Bootstrap 4`. Every page in the manager has it's own `Vue` app which is created after the page is returned from the server. All reusable parts in the manager also has their own `Vue` app. The reason for choosing this design and not building a full javascript client is so that you can choose how you would like to build your custom pages in the manager, whether it's **MVC** or **Razor Pages**.

## Main Vue Apps

The following main apps are available in the manager, please note that to access them from your pages you must add a javascript reference for them in your page.
