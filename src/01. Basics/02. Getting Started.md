# Getting Started

> The fastest way to get started is to use one of the Project Templates available. If you want to read more about this, please go to [Project Templates](project-templates).


## Installing From NuGet

All libraries and components for Piranha is available on NuGet. You can read more about all of the available core packages [here](packages).


## Installing From GitHub

If you want the latest source code and maybe be a part of the community and contribute to Piranha you should head over to `GitHub`. You can read more about this in [Contribute](contribute).

## Project Setup

### Configure the services

When configuring the services you should register of the Piranha modules you want to use. As an example, let's look at the service configuration for a project that uses `SQLite` and `Piranha.AspNetCore.Identity.SQLite`.

~~~ csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddLocalization(options =>
        options.ResourcesPath = "Resources"
    );
    services.AddMvc()
        .AddPiranhaManagerOptions()
        .SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);

    services.AddPiranha();
    services.AddPiranhaApplication();
    services.AddPiranhaFileStorage();
    services.AddPiranhaImageSharp();
    services.AddPiranhaManager();

    services.AddPiranhaEF(options =>
        options.UseSqlite("Filename=./piranha.razorweb.db"));
    services.AddPiranhaIdentityWithSeed<IdentitySQLiteDb>(options =>
        options.UseSqlite("Filename=./piranha.razorweb.db"));
}
~~~

## Configure the application

Once the services has been configure you initialize the Piranha CMS application. Let's again look at how it's done in the example project. Please note that generic AspNetCore setup has been omitted.

~~~ csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, IApi api)
{
    ...
    // Initialize Piranha
    App.Init(api);

    // Build page types
    var pageTypeBuilder = new Piranha.AttributeBuilder.PageTypeBuilder(api)
        .AddType(typeof(Models.StandardPage))
        .AddType(typeof(Models.TeaserPage));
    pageTypeBuilder.Build()
        .DeleteOrphans();

    // Register middleware
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UsePiranha();
    app.UsePiranhaManager();

    app.UseMvc(routes =>
    {
        ...
    });
    ...
}
~~~

The important part here is the **order** in which middleware is registered. The current `security` component should always be registered before the rest of the Piranha middleware, and the rest of the Piranha middleware should be registered **before** MVC. This is needed as the middleware re-writes the request and passes it on to the correct MVC route that should handle it.
