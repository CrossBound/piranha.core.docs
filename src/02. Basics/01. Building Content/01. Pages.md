# Pages

> For general information on the different rules & components available when defining content types, please refer to [Building Content](../building-content).

The content templates of your Pages are designed using Page types. Remember that this does not necessarily mean that all pages of the same Page type has to be rendered the same way, it simply means that they have the same content structure.

The preferred way of importing Page types is by using the `Piranha.AttributeBuilder` package. With this package you can directly mark your **Page models** with the Attributes needed.

## Defining a Page Type

Here's a simple example of a page with a `Markdown` region.

    using Piranha.AttributeBuilder;
    using Piranha.Extend.Fields;
    using Piranha.Models;

    [PageType(Title = "Markdown Page")]
    public class MarkdownPage : Page<MarkdownPage>
    {
        [Region(Title = "Main Content")]
        public MarkdownField Body { get; set; }
    }

To import this page type during your application startup you add the following line to your `Configure` method.

    using Piranha.AttributeBuilder;

    var builder = new PageTypeBuilder(api)
        .AddType(typeof(MarkdownPage));
    builder.Build();

As you can see the `PageTypeAttribute` allows you to set the **title** that will be displayed in the manager interface. If this property is left blank the class name is used.

## Disable Blocks For Page Types

If you don't want to use the **Block Editor** you can disable this for your Page Type by adding the following to the `PageTypeAttribute`.

    [PageType(Title = "Markdown Page", UseBlocks = false)]

## Page Routing

By default, all page request are rewritten to the route `/page`. Since you want to load different model types for your pages, and often render them by different views you need to specify which route should handle your Page type. Let's say we have a page that also displays a banner on top.

    [PageType(Title = "Markdown Page")]
    [PageTypeRoute(Title = "Default", Route = "/bannerpage")]
    public class BannerPage : Page<BannerPage>
    {
        public class BannerRegion
        {
            [Field]
            public StringField Title { get; set; }
            [Field]
            public ImageField Image { get; set; }
            [Field]
            public TextField Body { get; set; }
        }

        [Region(Title = "Main Content")]
        public MarkdownField Body { get; set; }

        [Region]
        public BannerRegion Banner { get; set; }
    }

As you can see, requests for pages of this page type will now be routed to `/bannerpage`.

## Specifying Multiple Page Routes

Let's say we would also like to use our Banner Page as the Startpage of the site, but we might want to handle it differently by adding some content from another system, or send it to a different view. We can then just add a second `PageRouteAttribute` to our class.

    [PageType(Title = "Markdown Page")]
    [PageTypeRoute(Title = "Default", Route = "/bannerpage")]
    [PageTypeRoute(Title = "Start Page", Route = "/startpage")]
    public class BannerPage : Page<BannerPage>
    {
        ...
    }

By adding a second route the page **settings** will now show a dropdown where the editor can select which route the current page should use.

## Custom Editors

`[ This feature was added in Version 7.0 ]`

In some cases you might want to create a special kind of page that should include a completely different editor. An example of this is **Archive Pages** which includes a completely different editor for handling the post archive of the page.

A page can have **any number** of custom editors which can be acheived by adding multiple editor attributes to the page type.

    [PageType(Title = "Product Page")]
    [PageTypeEditor(Title = "Products", Component = "product-editor", Icon = "fas fa-fish")]
    public class ProductPage : Page<ProductPage>
    {
        ...
    }

Custom editors are implemented as **Global Vue** components and are responsible for handling their own data, both loading and saving. Custom components are added to the manager by registering custom javscript resource in the manager module. For more information see [Custom Resources](../../manager-extensions/custom-resources).

## A Real World Example

As an example, let's define a Page type for a typical **start page** of a Site. The startpage should contain a **Hero** with an image, title and HTML body. Then we want a section with **Teasers** that can be linked to other pages in the site. As main content we'll use the standard **Blocks**.

    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using Piranha.AttributeBuilder;
    using Piranha.Models;
    using Piranha.Extend.Fields;

    public class HeroRegion
    {
        [Field(Placeholder = "Hero Title", Options = FieldOption.HalfWidth)]
        public StringField Title { get; set; }

        [Field(Title = "Primary Image", Options = FieldOption.HalfWidth)]
        public ImageField PrimaryImage { get; set; }

        [Field]
        public HtmlField Body { get; set; }
    }

    public class TeaserRegion
    {
        [Field(Placeholder = "Teaser title")]
        public StringField Title { get; set; }

        [Field(Options = FieldOption.HalfWidth)]
        public ImageField Image { get; set; }

        [Field(Title = "Page Link", Options = FieldOption.HalfWidth)]
        public PageField PageLink { get; set; }

        [Field]
        public HtmlField Body { get; set; }
    }

    [PageType(Title = "Start Page")]
    public class StartPage : Page<StartPage>
    {
        [Region(Description = "The main hero shown on the top of the start page.")]
        public HeroRegion Hero { get; set; }

        [Region(Description = "Teasers with links to other parts of the site.")]
        public IList<TeaserRegion> Teasers { get; set; } = new List<TeaserRegion>();
    }

This is how the view could look for rendering the page with **Bootstrap** given that we have a `Layout` defined in our project. The Layout code will be omitted from the example for clarity.

    @model StartPage
    @{
        ViewBag.Title = Model.Title;

        var hasHeroImage = Model.Hero.PrimaryImage.HasValue;
        var heroImageUrl = hasHeroImage ?
            $"background-image: url('{ Url.Content(Model.Hero.PrimaryImage) }')" : "";
    }

    <div class="hero" style="@(hasHeroImage ? heroImageUrl : "")">
        <div class="container">
            <h1>@Model.Hero.Title</h1>
            @Html.Raw(Model.Hero.Body)
        </div>
    </div>

    @if (Model.Teasers.Count > 0)
    {
        <div class="teasers">
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    @foreach (var teaser in Model.Teasers)
                    {
                        <div class="col-md teaser">
                            <h2>@teaser.Title</h2>
                            @if (teaser.Image.HasValue)
                            {
                                <img src="@Url.Content(teaser.Image)">
                            }
                            @Html.Raw(teaser.Body)
                            @if (teaser.PageLink.HasValue)
                            {
                                <a href="@teaser.PageLink.Page.Permalink">
                                    Read more
                                </a>
                            }
                        </div>
                    }
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    }

    @Html.DisplayFor(m => m.Blocks)
