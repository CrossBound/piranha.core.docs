# ImageSharp

The ImageSharp component is dependent on the external package `SixLabors.ImageSharp` which is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.ImageSharp/1.0.0-beta0006). Piranha CMS currently supports version `1.0.0-beta0006` of ImageSharp.

## Installation

> Please note that since the external `ImageSharp` package is in **pre-release** the `Piranha.ImageSharp` package has to be labeled pre-release as well.

The ImageSharp processor can be installed by adding the following NuGet package:

~~~ csharp
<PackageReference Include="Piranha.ImageSharp" Version="7.0.0-rc1" />
~~~
