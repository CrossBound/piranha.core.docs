# Authentication

Piranha doesn't really care **how** your users gets authenticated, whether it's the end users of your application or the administrators accessing the manager interface. Instead, Piranha uses a claims based security model to check what the current user has access to.

We provide two different packages for handling authentication, one for development and one for production scenarios.

To read more about how the implement custom authentication services for your application, please refer to [Authentication](../extensions/authentication) under the Extensions section.

## Core Claims

The core Piranha application has two Claims that are used when trying to preview unpublished content.

* `PiranhaPostPreview`
