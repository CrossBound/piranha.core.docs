# Simple Authentication

The Simple Security implementation is a simple user & authentication manager for development purposes. It does not persist any user data, instead the current user accounts are added into memory on application startup. It is **not recommended** to use Simple Security for production environments.

Simple Security depends on the `HttpContext` in order to sign in a user and can't be used for other types of applications.

## Installation

The Simple Security can be installed by adding the NuGet package:

~~~ csharp
<PackageReference Include="Piranha.AspNetCore.SimpleSecurity" Version="7.0.0" />
~~~

## Registering The Service

You register Simple Security in `ConfigureServices()` with the following call:

~~~ csharp
services.AddPiranhaSimpleSecurity(
    new Piranha.AspNetCore.SimpleUser(Piranha.Manager.Permission.All())
    {
        UserName = "admin",
        Password = "password"
    },
    ...
);
~~~~

Here you can create any number of users with different permissions that you need for your development environment.
