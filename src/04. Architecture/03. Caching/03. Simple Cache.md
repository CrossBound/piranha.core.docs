# Simple Cache

The Simple Cache is an **in-process** memory cache based on an `IDictionary<string, object>`. It's fast and does the job for simple runtime scenarios. The simple cache is included in the core `Piranha` package meaning that no additional packages needs to be installed to use it.

## Register The Service

To register the simple cache, simply add the following call to your `Startup.cs`.

~~~ csharp
using Piranha;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...

    services.AddPiranhaSimpleCache();

    ...
}
~~~

This will register the cache as a `Singleton` and it will be injected into all services. Please note that to actually **use** the cache in the repositories you need to set the current Cache Level of your application. For more information see [Caching](../caching).

## About Simple Cache

Please note that since simple caching is handled in the memory of the web server process it does **not work well** for web farms or clustered environments. For these types of setups you should consider using a distributed cache.
