# Distributed Cache

The Distributed Cache is dependent on the standard `IDistributedCache`. The distributed cache is included in the core `Piranha` package meaning that no additional packages needs to be installed.

Please note that for the cache to work you will need to have a cache service registered in your application that implement `IDistributedCache` as well, for example `RedisCache`.

## Register The Service

To register the distributed cache, simply add the following call to your `Startup.cs`.

~~~ csharp
using Piranha;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...

    services.AddPiranhaDistributedCache();

    ...
}
~~~

This will register the cache as a `Singleton` and it will be injected into all services. Please note that to actually **use** the cache in the repositories you need to set the current Cache Level of your application. For more information see [Caching](../caching).
