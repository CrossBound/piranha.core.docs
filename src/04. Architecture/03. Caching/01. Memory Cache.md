# Memory Cache

The Memory Cache is an **in-process** memory cache dependent on the standard `IMemoryCache`. The memory cache is included in the core `Piranha` package meaning that no additional packages needs to be installed.

Please note that for the cache to work you will need to have a cache service registered in your application that implements `IMemoryCache` as well.

## Register The Service

To register the memory cache, simply add the following call to your `Startup.cs`.

~~~ csharp
using Piranha;

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...

    services.AddPiranhaMemoryCache();

    ...
}
~~~

This will register the cache as a `Singleton` and it will be injected into all services. Please note that to actually **use** the cache in the repositories you need to set the current Cache Level of your application. For more information see [Caching](../caching).

## About Memory Cache

Please note that since memory caching is handled in the memory of the web server process it does **not work well** for web farms or clustered environments. For these types of setups you should consider using a distributed cache.
