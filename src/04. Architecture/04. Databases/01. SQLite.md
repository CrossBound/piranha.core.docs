# SQLite

> Please remember that if you're going to use our provided packages for ASP.NET Core Identity you will **also need need to include** the SQLite package for Identity. For more information, please refer to article about using [Identity](../authentication/identity) for Piranha.

## Installation

To use SQLite you need to add the NuGet package for running Piranha with `Entity Framework Core` as well as the Microsoft package for `SQLite`.

~~~ csharp
PM> install-package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SQLite
PM> install-package Piranha.Data.EF
~~~

## Registering The DbContext

After you've made sure you have the package reference you need you simply specify that you want to use SQLite **and** the connection information you want for your database in your `Startup.cs`.

~~~ csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    ...

    services.AddPiranhaEF(options =>
        options.UseSqlite("Filename=./mydatabase.db");

    ...
}
~~~~

That's it! You're now using SQLite with Piranha.
