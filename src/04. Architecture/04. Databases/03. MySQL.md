# MySQL

> Please remember that if you are going to use our provided packages for ASP.NET Core Identity you will **also need need to include** the MySQL package for Identity. For more information, please refer to the article about using [Identity](../authentication/identity) for Piranha.

## Installation

To use MySQL you need to add the NuGet package for running Piranha with `Entity Framework Core` as well as a MySQL provider for ASP.NET Core. It is recommend to use the package provided by the [Pomelo Foundation](https://github.com/PomeloFoundation), namely [Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
](https://github.com/PomeloFoundation/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql), as it is also used by the [Piranha package for ASP.NET Core Identity for MySQL](https://github.com/PiranhaCMS/piranha.core.mysql) and will work nicely if you decide to use the manager and identity package later on.

To get started, simply install the following packages:

~~~ csharp
PM> install-package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
PM> install-package Piranha.Data.EF
~~~

optional

~~~csharp
PM> install-package Piranha.AspNetCore.Identity.MySQL
~~~


## Registering The DbContext

After you made sure you have the package reference you need you simply specify that you want to use MySQL **and** the connection information you want for your database in your `Startup.cs`. It is good practice to specify your connection string in your `appsettings.json` so you can have different connection strings for different environments, such as,

~~~ json
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "mydb": "server=<THE-HOST-URL>;port=<THE-PORT>;database=<THE-DATABASE-SCHEME>;uid=<THE-DATABASE-USER>;password=<THE-PASSWORD>"
    }
}
~~~

Once the configuration is set up it can be used in the `ConfigureServices` of the `Startup.cs` as shown below.

~~~ csharp
public class Startup
{
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; private set; }

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddPiranha(options =>
        {
            ...

            var connString = Configuration.GetConnectionString("mydb");

            options.UseEF<Piranha.Data.EF.MySql.MySqlDb>(o =>
            {
                o.UseMySql(connString);
            });

            // optional
            // first add nuget package Piranha.AspNetCore.Identity.MySQL
            options.UseIdentityWithSeed<Piranha.AspNetCore.Identity.MySQL.IdentityMySQLDb>(db => db.UseMySql(connString));

            ...

        });
            

        
    }
}
~~~

That's it! You're now using MySQL with Piranha.

## Configuration Options

The used MySQL package provides a number of configuration options, such as, character optinos, server versions etc. which are described in detail in the [package Wiki](https://github.com/PomeloFoundation/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql/wiki/Configuration-Options).
