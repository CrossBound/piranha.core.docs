# Source Code

If you want to get your hands on the latest version and/or maybe contribute to the project the best way is to **fork** the repo to your user account and get going.

## Clone And Restore

Getting started with the source code is easy. After you've clone the repository, simply perform the following steps on your development machine.

    > git clone <your repo here>
    > cd piranha.core
    > dotnet restore
    > cd core/Piranha.Manager
    > npm install
    > cd ../../
    > cd examples/RazorWeb
    > npm install
    > cd ../examples/MvcWeb
    > npm install
    > cd ../../

This process will restore all `NuGet` packages as well as all front-end libraries used by the manager and example project.

## Build And Run

To run the project to can start the included **example projects**. Please note that the example projects is intended to be used for development, they are not templates or themes and are **not in any way** included as part of the distribution packages.

**Starting The MVC Example**

    > cd examples/MvcWeb
    > dotnet build
    > dotnet run

**Starting The Razor Pages Example**

    > cd examples/RazorWeb
    > dotnet build
    > dotnet run

## Recompiling Assets

Both the **manager** and the **example** projects uses `Gulp` to build front-end assets. This is the commands available for building assets.

**Manager Assets**

    > gulp min:css    // compiles and minifies stylesheets
    > gulp min:js     // combines and minifies javascripts
    > gulp min:editor // compiles and minifies stylesheets used by the TinyMCE editor

**Example Projects**

    > gulp min:css    // compiles and minifies stylesheets
    > gulp min:js     // combines and minifies javascripts
